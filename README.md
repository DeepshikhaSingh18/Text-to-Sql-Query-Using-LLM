# Text-to-Sql-Query-Using-LLM
This project leverages Google Gemini AI to convert English language questions into SQL queries. It uses Streamlit for the frontend and SQLite for the backend to retrieve and display data from a database of UPI transactions. The AI interprets user input and generates SQL queries to fetch relevant data from the database.
